## Title of the Project

TRAIN DELAY PREDICTION SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->

Train delays are a common issue in railway networks worldwide, including India, causing inconvenience to passengers, disrupting schedules, and affecting operational efficiency. These delays can be caused by a variety of factors such as track congestion, maintenance work, weather conditions, technical failures, and operational inefficiencies. Traditional methods of handling train schedules rely on static timetables, which are unable to dynamically adapt to real-time changes.

Machine Learning (ML) provides an opportunity to analyze historical train data along with real-time factors to predict delays more accurately. By learning patterns from past delays, ML models can forecast the expected delay for upcoming trains, enabling railway authorities and passengers to make better-informed decisions. This project aims to develop a predictive system using machine learning algorithms to estimate train delays, providing timely information to minimize inconvenience and improve railway operations.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The train delay prediction system successfully forecasts the expected delay for trains based on features such as scheduled departure and arrival times, route distance, train type, day of the week, and historical delays.

The results indicate that the model can predict delays with reasonable accuracy, minimizing large errors and effectively accounting for variations in train schedules. 

Overall, the system provides actionable insights for passengers and railway operators, enabling better planning and decision-making.
